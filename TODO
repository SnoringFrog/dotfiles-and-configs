- Relocate files into .d directories
- Create a core shellrc file for things shared between zsh/bash

		- readppt
		- md5check
		- sumcheck
		- ascii_to_hex
		- windows/Cygwin specific:
			- AHK_DIR

			- gch path
- Combine .bash_profile and .bashrc into .bashrc
- Write function for adding to PATH
	- if not already in path, if dir exists, add it to path
- Add .vim (or at least the syntax files and such?)
- Find my whitespace syntax highlighter again
- Use different repo branches for different OS's?
- Edit any function that deletes files with any potential to be needed to check for my recycle system
	- use an env var for that?
